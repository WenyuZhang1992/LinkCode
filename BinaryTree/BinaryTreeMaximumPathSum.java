 * Leetcode 124: Binary Tree Maximum PathSum
 * Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
 * For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to 
 * any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. 
 * The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.
